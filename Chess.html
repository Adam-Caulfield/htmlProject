    <p>Chess is one of my favourite hobbies, and I consider myself an advanced player. However, I also enjoy watching the highest-tier play as well.
    </p>
    <p> According to ChatGPT, although it struggles with playing chess, it can talk about it. Chess is a timeless strategy game that has captivated players for centuries. Known for its deep complexity and mental challenge, chess is played on a square board divided into 64 squares, where two opponents, each commanding 16 pieces, aim to checkmate the opposing king. The game combines elements of tactics and strategy, requiring players to think several moves ahead while anticipating their opponent’s actions. Every piece on the board — from the pawns to the powerful rooks, knights, and queens — has its own unique movement, offering a variety of ways to approach the game. Chess is not only a battle of intellect but also a test of patience, foresight, and creativity. From casual games in parks to grandmaster tournaments, chess continues to be a global phenomenon, enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels.</p>
    
    <p>This emphasizes how chess ranges from human to computer to artificial intelligence. The game itself is set up as follows:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>16 pawns (8 black, 8 white)</li>
        <li>4 knights (2 black, 2 white)</li>
        <li>4 bishops (2 black, 2 white)</li>
        <li>4 rooks (2 black, 2 white)</li>
        <li>2 queens (1 black, 1 white)</li>
        <li>2 kings (1 black, 1 white)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>The setup is as follows for white pawns along the second row. The first row has all the pieces going from left to right: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook.</p>
